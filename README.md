# My own portfolio website

I've created this website to showcase my projects and skills. It's a work in progress, but I'm happy with the results so far. I've used React and Tailwind CSS to build it. I've also designed the website in Figma.

## **Design**

I've designed the website in Figma. You can see the design [here](https://www.figma.com/file/tjEOk3CWJfj0DLCEGo0Gxb/michalk.nl?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&t=9mRzWozHMP9iELxt-1).

### **Why Figma**
I've used Figma for school projects and I've found it to be a great tool for designing websites. It's easy to use and it's free. I've also used Adobe XD, but I prefer Figma.
